## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon (data fetched from [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com))

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & Media Queries for responsiveness)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API calls


### What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- **DOM manipulation** using `querySelector` and `textContent`
- Handling **async/await** with `try...catch`
- Using **Axios** to fetch data from APIs
- Responsive design with **flexbox** and media queries

Example snippet Iâ€™m proud of:

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  let adviceObj = await genAdvice();
  adviceId.textContent = "Advice #" + adviceObj.slip.id;
  advice.textContent = `"${adviceObj.slip.advice}"`;
});
